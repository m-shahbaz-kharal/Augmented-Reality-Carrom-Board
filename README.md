# Augmented-Reality-Carrom-Board
“Augmented Reality” sometimes also called “Mixed Reality” is the new way to experience
virtual objects in real world. It’s like seeing virtual things blended with the real world,
through a phone camera and it is so beautiful that you feel like you united both the computer
world and your real world in an almost seamless way.
“Augmented Carrom Board” will use the same technology to make you feel like more closer
to how you played it on real boards. It’ll scan the environment, project a board to it (visible
through a phone screen), set up the game for you, you’ll wear a specialized controller and
there you go place your finger (yes your real hand finger) close to the striker on the board, aim
like the way you do and flick when ready, the game will capture your hand movements, your aim
and game board along with the pieces will react like the real game and that is our imagination
to make the play more real.
